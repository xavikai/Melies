Hi,
First thank you for choosing the asset :).

-----

CAUTION:

I you use Unity 6: Donâ€™t forget to install URP package.
If the prefabs are pink when you open the demo scene, this means that URP Package is not installed or configured correctly.


First Case:
Your Unity 6 project is setup as a URP project:
- Close Unity.
- Then re-open Unity.
It should solve the problem.


Second Case: You have the following error message: the type or namespace name universal does not exist...
This means that URP Package is not installed.

If you do not have URP installed, other error messages may appear in the console. Install URP to make console errors disappear.
